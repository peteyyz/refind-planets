# refind-planets

A rEFInd bootloader theme with no distro logos, just planets.

rEFInd: https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/

Copy into your Refind /themes directory and add this to your refind.conf file:

include themes/planets/theme.conf

All icons and backgrounds are in the /img directory. Rename the os_ and func_ files to your liking.

Frequently Unasked Questions:
* No, I do not use Windows 8. That's just the name that worked for the win icon.
* Yes, I have all these distros installed on two SSDs.
* Yes, it is ridiculous.
* BTW, I use Void.
* Sorry, I do not have a Mac. Just rename the image file of the most Mac-like planet.

Acknowledgements:
Many. Sorry, I have no idea where all these images came from. Most were edited with Gimp for consistency and lighting.

Hope you like!
